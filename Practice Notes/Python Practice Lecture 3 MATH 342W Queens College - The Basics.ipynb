    "# Python Practice Lecture 3 MATH 342W Queens College - The Basics\n",
    "## Author: Amir ElTabakh\n",
    "## Date: February 4, 2021\n",

    "## Basic Python\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is an open-source high-level programming language\n",
    "* Interpreted, object-oriented, and scripted\n",
    "* Has a tremendous developer community and industry community\n",
    "* It is very attractive for Rapid Application Development\n",
    "* History: In 1989 Guido van Rossum developed the language and named it after the BBC TV show *Monty Python's Flying Circus*\n",
    "\n",
    "Upsides? \n",
    "* General-purpose tool used in a wide range of industries\n",
    "* Python is a high-level programming language, therefore Python code resembles natural language\n",
    "* Dynamic semantics allows developers to declare variables without declaring the variable's type.\n",
    "* Python is platform-agnostic, you can run the same source code across operating systems, this is achieved due to bytecode and a Python Virtual Machine.\n",
    "* Python easily teams up with other languages using extensions like [Cython](https://cython.org/) for C, [Gython](https://pypi.org/project/gython/) for Go, [Jython](https://www.jython.org/) for Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "Downsides?\n",
    "* Slow (but this can be fixed by inlining other languages). This is mostly due to the fact that it is an interpreted and dynamically-typed language.\n",
    "* No multithreading\n",
    "* High memory consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Jupyter Notebook? \n",
    "\n",
    "* An integrated developer environment (IDE). It is not the only IDE for Python, but it is one of the most popular at the time of this writing. Click [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html#what-is-the-jupyter-notebook) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "File types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The standard Python script has a `.py` extension\n",
    "* This file if you note has an `.ipynb` extension meaning it is a notebook file. You can enter markdown scripts, images, and code all in a notebook file. You could run an `.ipynb` file outside of Jupyter, such as in Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to know:\n",
    "* We will be using Python 3\n",
    "* You can specify the type cell in the toolbar (Code or Markdown)\n",
    "* Access shortcuts and tools about Jupyter Notebook through the Help tab.\n",
    "* Don't be afraid to pull out your Google-Fu!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some Python! Since Python is interpreted, you can run commands directly into a command terminal. We will skip that step, and begin working directly on the notebook through cells. Click on a cell and hit ctrl-enter to run the cell. You could also press the Run button on the toolbar above."
